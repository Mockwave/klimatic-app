# klimatic-app
A climate app written in flutter.

This app provides details of temperature, humidity and condition of a place. 
The default place is set to my home town (i.e Bangalore). 
The users can navigate to an another screen and enter the name of the city of their choice.
The app fetches data in a JSON format from an free API.
When the users tap on "Get Weather" the app redirects back to the home screen and gives them the temperature, humidity and condition of that place.
